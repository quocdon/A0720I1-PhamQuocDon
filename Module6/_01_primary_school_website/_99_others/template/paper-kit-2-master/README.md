![Paper Kit](http://s3.amazonaws.com/creativetim_bucket/products/33/original/opt_pk_thumbnail.jpg "Paper Kit Free")

Paper Kit is a free Bootstrap UI kit that can get you going in a new creative direction! To say the least, it's different since it's not material, flat or iOS inspired. We hope the kit will help you make your mark and create something new. Using it is extremely convenient, since it offers fully responsive design and elements that are easy to use.

We created this kit having paper and drawings in mind. We tried to focus on pale colours, beautiful typography and thoughtful drawings. If you like the result, you can use it in your projects for free. You can import it in an old project and make it look fresh, or you can start a new one. It's very easy to use and to integrate.

Every element in the kit comes in fresh colour scheme, that goes from light blue to orange. Check out the [live preview](http://demos.creative-tim.com/paper-kit) to see how they fit!

**Bootstrap 3 support**
Paper Kit fully support Bootstrap3, since it is built on top of it. No worries there! We have redesigned most of its components, giving it a new look. If you are using a component we have not touched, it will gracefully fall back to the Bootstrap default.

We will support very soon Bootstrap 4.0.

**Examples**
The kit comes with three pre-built pages to help you get started faster. You can change the text and images and you're good to go. If you want to get a picture of what you can build with this powerful kit, you can see the examples here:
